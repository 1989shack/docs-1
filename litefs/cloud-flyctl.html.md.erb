You can create and manage a LiteFS Cloud cluster via `flyctl`.

## Create a LiteFS Cloud cluster

```cmd
fly litefs-cloud create
```

## Get a LiteFS Cloud token

```cmd
fly tokens create litefs-cloud --cluster $(cluster name)
```

## Destroy a LiteFS Cloud cluster

Note: this will destroy the LiteFS Cloud cluster, but it will not impact
your LiteFS cluster. Your data will continue to be available as long as
your LiteFS cluster has nodes. We recommend to
[configure alternative backups][Backing up your LiteFS cluster] before taking
this action.

[Backing up your LiteFS cluster]: /docs/litefs/backup

```cmd
fly litefs-cloud delete $(cluster name)
```
