You can create and manage a LiteFS Cloud cluster via `flyctl`.

## Create a LiteFS Cloud cluster

```cmd
fly litefs-cloud create
```

## Get a LiteFS Cloud token

```cmd
fly tokens create litefs-cloud --cluster my-cluster
```

## Restore a LiteFS Cluster to a specific point in time

You can restore your LiteFS cluster to any specific point in time (since you've
configured LiteFS Cloud).

```cmd
fly litefs-cloud restore my-cluster [--timestamp 2023-06-12T15:55]
```

## Destroy a LiteFS Cloud cluster

Note: this will destroy the LiteFS Cloud cluster, but it will not impact
your LiteFS cluster. Your data will continue to be available as long as
your LiteFS cluster has nodes. We recommend to
[configure alternative backups][Backing up your LiteFS cluster] before taking
this action.

[Backing up your LiteFS cluster]: /docs/litefs/backup

```cmd
fly litefs-cloud delete my-cluster
```

If you intend to continue running your LiteFS cluster, don't forget to remove the
`LITEFS_CLOUD_TOKEN` after you've deleted your LiteFS Cloud cluster. If you don't,
LiteFS will continue to function, but performance may be negatively impacted, and
you will see errors in the logs. If you're running LiteFS on Fly.io, you unset the
secret:

```cmd
fly secrets unset LITEFS_CLOUD_TOKEN
```
