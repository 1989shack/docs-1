LiteFS is a distributed file system that transparently replicates SQLite
databases. This lets you run your application like it's running against a local
on-disk SQLite database but behind the scenes the database is replicated to all
the nodes in your cluster. This lets you run your database right next to your
application on the edge.

## Project status

LiteFS is stable and running in production environments. The project is still
pre-1.0 so APIs may change and features could be removed. Please remember that
all software has bugs so we recommend you [set up regular off-site
backups][backup] in case of malfunction or disk corruption.
