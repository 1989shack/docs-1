LiteFS is a distributed file system that transparently replicates SQLite
databases. This lets you run your application like it's running against a local
on-disk SQLite database but behind the scenes the database is replicated to all
the nodes in your cluster. This lets run your database right next to your
application on the edge. You can run LiteFS anywhere!

LiteFS Cloud is a Fly.io service which provides backups and recovery for your
LiteFS SQLite database. You can use LiteFS Cloud to back up your LiteFS database
running anywhere (whether your application is running on Fly.io or somewhere else).

## Project status

LiteFS is stable and running in production environments. The project is still
pre-1.0 so APIs may change and features could be removed. Please remember that
all software has bugs so we recommend you set up regular off-site
backups in case of malfunction or disk corruption. You can back up
using [LiteFS Cloud][], or [configure your own backups][backup].
