If you are running a small/simple application making use of a higher level framework like
[Next.js](../../languages-and-frameworks/nextjs/) or [Remix](../../languages-and-frameworks/remix/) the information provided on these pages may be useful as background information.

Other applications using things like [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/),
or even [http.server](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserver) may require additional set up.

These guides will help you get through the basics of setting up your JavaScript application with pieces of infrastructure commonly found in medium-to-high complexity JavaScript applications.
