Through flyctl, postgres exposes a few configuration options that can be set to tune the database for your application's needs.
But before you start tuning, it's important to understand the tradeoffs that you're making. 

## View current configuration

To view the current configuration, run `fly postgres config view--app <app-name>`.:
```cmd
fly postgres config view --app myapp
```

```output
NAME                      	VALUE  	UNIT	DESCRIPTION                                                                                	PENDING RESTART 
log-min-duration-statement	-1     	ms  	Sets the minimum execution time above which all statements will be logged. (-1, 2147483647)	false          	
log-statement             	none   	    	Sets the type of statements logged. [none, ddl, mod, all]                                  	false          	
max-connections           	300    	    	Sets the maximum number of concurrent connections. (1, 262143)                             	false          	
shared-buffers            	131072 	8kB 	Sets the number of shared memory buffers used by the server. (16, 1073741823)              	false          	
shared-preload-libraries  	       	    	Lists shared libraries to preload into server.                                             	false          	
wal-level                 	replica	    	Sets the level of information written to the WAL. [minimal, replica, logical]              	false   	
```
For more information on these settings, see the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config.html).

## Update configuration settings

To demo how this works we'll update the `max-connections` setting from 300 to 500. 
```cmd 
fly pg config update --max-connections 500  --app <app-name>
```
  
```output
NAME           	VALUE	TARGET VALUE	RESTART REQUIRED
max-connections	400  	500         	true
```

Now that we have issued our restart, we can take one last look at our config view and see that our max-connections value has now officially been applied!
```cmd
fly postgres config view --app <app-name>
```

```output
NAME                      	VALUE  	DESCRIPTION                                                                                	PENDING RESTART
log-min-duration-statement	-1     	Sets the minimum execution time above which all statements will be logged. (-1, 2147483647)	false
log-statement             	none   	Sets the type of statements logged. [none, ddl, mod, all]                                  	false
max-connections           	500    	Sets the maximum number of concurrent connections. (1, 262143)                             	false
wal-level                 	replica	Set the level of information written to the WAL. [minimal, replica, logical]               	false
```

The current list of configurable settings is quite short… If there are additional settings you’d like to see configurable, let us know!
