Create a Machine, which starts running immediately. This is where you configure the Machine characteristics, like its CPU and memory. You can also allow connections from the internet through the Fly Proxy. Learn more about this behavior in the [networking section](#networking).

Following this call, you can make a [blocking API request](#wait-for-a-machine-to-reach-a-specified-state) to wait for a Machine to start.
